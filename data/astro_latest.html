Researchers have directly observed torsional AlfvÃ©n waves twisting through the Sunâ€™s corona â€” magnetic waves first predicted over 80 years ago. Captured using the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope, these motions could explain why the corona is millions of degrees hotter than the Sunâ€™s surface. The finding helps validate decades of solar physics theories and opens new paths to studying solar energy transfer.

Dark matter has two central properties: it has mass like regular matter, and unlike regular matter, it reacts weakly or not at all with light. Neutrinos satisfy these two criteria, but neutrinos move through space at nearly the speed of light, making them a form of hot dark matter. The observations we have suggest that dark matter is cold.
